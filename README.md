# createcoverletter
just simple python script that saves some time to create a cover letter for job applications

basically, in my cover letter, i have the text 'INSERT_COMPANY' and 'INSERT_POSITION' wherever I add the company and position name for each job application i do. since i've applied to over 200 job applications in the last few weeks (and who knows how many in the past few months), i began to lose my sanity having to type those in each time and then export the doc as a pdf. 

so i wrote this simple python script that automates this process. i added #TODO comments in the script where you should write the name of your base cover letter word file as well as where you should change the INSERT_COMPANY/INSERT_POSITION to match your text field in your cover letter. or you could just use the same placeholders as i do
