# Automate Cover Letter PDF's for job applications


- in my cover letter, i have the text 'INSERT_COMPANY' and 'INSERT_POSITION' wherever I add the company and position name for each job application i do (shown below)

- since i've applied to over 200 job applications in the last few weeks (and who knows how many in the past few months), i began to lose my sanity having to type those in each time and then export the doc as a pdf.
- this simple python script that automates this process
  1. i added #TODO comments in the script where you should write the name of your base cover letter word file as well as where you should change the INSERT_COMPANY/INSERT_POSITION to match the text field in your cover letter
